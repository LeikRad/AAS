\section{Results and Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metrics:} Do not just show Accuracy. You must include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
        \item Confusion Matrix.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Comparisons:} Compare different models (e.g., Random Forest vs. Naive Bayes) or different feature sets.
    \item \textbf{Security Analysis:} Discuss False Positives vs. False Negatives. In your specific context, which is worse? (e.g., Blocking a CEO's legitimate email vs. letting a virus through).
\end{itemize}
